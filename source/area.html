          <p>As our phones connect us to more and more of the world around us, identifying the people who try to contact us becomes more meaningful. Your first line of defense is the area code: the first three digits of an incoming phone <a href="#">number that identify where the caller is from.</a></p>

          <p>In some cases, screening an area code is simple; a local phone number is more trustworthy, while business phone numbers with an 800 area code may earn more concern. Just as you screen incoming calls based on their area codes, many others will get their first impression of you from your area code.</p>

          <h2>[H2] Why Would You Change Your Area Code?</h2>

          <p>There are plenty of valid reasons why you would not want your area code attached to your phone number at all times. Having an area code that narrows down where in the world you live is uncomfortable for some people, especially given the targeted forms of scam calling certain regions to get.</p>
          <p>In a world where personal privacy is becoming harder to come by every day, it is understandable that you would want some control over how your phone number is presented to strangers.</p>
          <p>Luckily, there are several ways you can take action and change your area code if that is the route you want to take. It is not uncommon for people to want to change their number for privacy and other concerns. Regardless of your motivations, changing your area code can involve varying levels of work and effort depending on what method you choose.</p>
          <p>There are different ways of doing this, with pros and cons for each method, but they will do the trick if you are looking for another area code. Specifically, here are a few ways to give yourself a phone number with an area code from Fort Collins and its surrounding areas.</p>

          <h2>You Could Buy Your Phone in Fort Collins</h2>

          <p>This may seem unhelpful, but the most traditional way to do this would be to go to the city of Fort Collins in person. If you set up your phone in a place that has a Fort Collins area code, your number will be attached to that area code by default.</p>
          <p>Like with any phone number, your geographical location when you get the number and set up the phone will determine your area code. You should note that this is a solution for either mobile or landline phones, as it doesn’t require any work beyond buying a phone and getting service for the device set up.</p>
          <p>That said, buying a whole new phone isn’t something many people are willing to do just to change their area code. At the same time, you can buy a cheap burner phone from the area just to have a phone number with a Fort Collins area code, which still requires money and a lot of travel potentially, depending on where you live.</p>
          <p>In truth, this is a lot more trouble than it would be worth to get a number with a Fort Collins area code. While this method works perfectly fine, there are much easier ways to achieve the same result without going on a road trip to Fort Collins, Colorado, with some saved-up cash.</p>
