If we don’t work to fine-tune our awareness of our resulting assumptions and prejudices, they can easily creep into our communication and behavior patterns, irreparably damaging our relationships.

            <li>
              <b>Mode overload:</b> Let’s face it: There are a lot of modes of communication at play today. From the phone (which recently unseated email as the preferred channel for communicating with businesses) to social media to AI-powered chatbots –– the conversation is always happening somewhere and the overwhelm can feel truly paralyzing. (Fortunately, it all comes full circle –– modern tech solutions can help you tame the communication mode beast.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hardware barriers:</b> So much of our communication now happens when we’re physically separated. And that can mean having wrestling matches with your hardware when things like poor phone or internet connections rear their ugly heads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Noise and distractions: </b> Remember the children who interrupted their dad’s live BBC News interview? Background noise and distractions abound. And sure, sometimes they’re endearing, but other times, they have a detrimental effect on your communication efforts.

          <p>“It’s like I’m talking to a brick wall!” </p>

          <p>You’ve probably heard this line of dialogue before. Perhaps it was in a TV show or movie. But every customer trying to communicate with a business can probably relate to the frustration it conjures.</p>

          <p>Everyone wants to feel heard. So, why does it so often feel like the person on the other end of the line isn’t actually listening?</p>

          <p>Listening is a skill so obvious (and drilled into us so early) it’s often forgotten –– or half-assed.</p>
